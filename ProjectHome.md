#### Welcome ####

This is project that contains some instructions and a few required files for integrating Notepad++ with Stata and other statistics programs (SAS, Python, Stat-Transfer, etc).

1.  First, go to the **[Instructions](http://code.google.com/p/notepad-stats-integration/wiki/Instructions)** wiki to learn about the process;

2.  Then click on the **[Source](http://code.google.com/p/notepad-stats-integration/source/browse/)** tabs to download the required files.

#### Why? ####

To quote from one of our contributers (Andre):

> ...`[`These`]` instructions and files for using NPP have been immensely helpful for me.  I have been working with 10 years of data from 7 datasets for my dissertation, starting with the original datasets.  The data management was immense and I would not have been able to complete it all in time without the functionality of NPP.  Even Stata's new program editor is weak compared to NPP.

#### Looking for Help ####

I'd be thrilled to start getting comments, suggestions, improvements to the code and/or the wiki.  I hope this turns into a collaborative effort. I'd be happy to grant "contributer" access to anyone who asks.

I created a wiki with a couple of ideas for a Version 2.0 for those that are interested.
